# watch-dog Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: 2026-02-28

## Active Technologies
- Go 1.21+ (existing) + Docker Engine API (github.com/docker/docker/client), standard library, log/slog (existing) (002-docker-healthcheck)
- Go 1.25 (go.mod); compatible with Go 1.21+ + github.com/docker/docker/client (Docker Engine API), gopkg.in/yaml.v3 (compose parsing), standard library, log/slog (003-fix-children-handling)
- N/A (no persistent storage; discovery and state from Docker API and compose file) (003-fix-children-handling)
- Go 1.21+ (go.mod may specify 1.25; compatible 1.21+) + Docker Engine API (github.com/docker/docker/client), standard library, log/slog, gopkg.in/yaml.v3 (compose parsing) (004-child-deps-initial-restart)
- N/A (discovery and state from Docker API and compose file) (004-child-deps-initial-restart)

- Go 1.21+ + Docker Engine API (e.g. github.com/docker/docker/client), standard library (001-container-health-monitor)
